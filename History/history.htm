                <p class="hanasparuh">
                    
                Centuries ago, the land that would come to be known as Bulgaria was a crossroads of civilizations. <br>
                Its history began with the arrival of the Bulgar tribes in the 7th century. <br>
                <br>
                Led by Khan Asparuh, they crossed the Danube River and established the First Bulgarian Empire in 681 AD. <br>
                The city of Pliska became its capital, marking the birth of Bulgarian statehood. <br>
                <br>
                Under the Bulgar rulers, the empire flourished and expanded its territory. <br>
                The Bulgarians assimilated with the local Slavic and Thracian populations, creating a unique fusion of cultures. <br>

                    On that photo, you can see Khan Asparuh and his army going into the first capital, Pliska. <br>
                    Khan Asparuh belonged to the Bulgars, a Turkic-speaking nomadic people who originated in Central Asia.  <br>
                    <br>
                    
                    <br>
                    Guided by his strategic vision and unwavering determination, Asparuh unified various Bulgar tribes under the banner of Old Great Bulgaria, forming a powerful confederation.<br>
                    With the establishment of the First Bulgarian Empire, Khan Asparuh and his successors embarked on a series of military campaigns and diplomatic endeavors.  <br>
                    <br>
                    
                    <br>
                    Their aim was to expand the territory of Bulgaria and forge alliances with neighboring tribes and states.  
                    The empire gradually assimilated Slavic tribes living in the region, fostering a cultural amalgamation that gave rise to the distinct Bulgarian identity.

                <p class="mid">
                    The Bulgarian Golden Age of the 9th and 10th centuries refers to a period when the First Bulgarian Empire, 
                    under the rule of Khan Krum and later Tsar Simeon I, experienced significant political, cultural, and military achievements. 
                    During this era, the Bulgarian Empire reached its territorial and cultural zenith, exerting influence over a vast region of Southeastern Europe.
                    Under the leadership of Khan Krum, the Bulgarian Empire expanded its borders, defeating Byzantine armies and establishing Bulgarian control over territories in the Balkans. 
                    The empire's military successes and strategic alliances enabled it to assert itself as a major regional power.

                <p class="mid">
                     Bulgarian Golden Age also witnessed a flourishing of arts, culture, and education. Preslav, the capital of the Bulgarian Empire at the time, became a center of learning and artistic activity. The Preslav Literary School, led by scholars like Chernorizets Hrabar and Constantine of Preslav, 
                    produced remarkable works of literature, translations, and liturgical texts.

                    During this period, the Bulgarian Orthodox Church gained autonomy from the Byzantine Church, and the Cyrillic script, attributed to the brothers Cyril and Methodius, was adopted and further developed by Bulgarian scholars. 
                    This script played a crucial role in the dissemination of literature and the preservation of the Bulgarian language and culture.</p>

                    Since gaining independence, Bulgaria has gone through various political and social changes, including the transition from monarchy to socialism and, eventually, a democratic system. Today, Bulgaria is a member of the European Union and NATO, contributing to its continued development and integration into the international community.
