                Centuries ago, the land that would come to be known as Bulgaria was a crossroads of civilizations. <br>
                Its history began with the arrival of the Bulgar tribes in the 7th century. <br>
                <br>
                Led by Khan Asparuh, they crossed the Danube River and established the First Bulgarian Empire in 681 AD. <br>
                The city of Pliska became its capital, marking the birth of Bulgarian statehood. <br>
                <br>
                Under the Bulgar rulers, the empire flourished and expanded its territory. <br>
                The Bulgarians assimilated with the local Slavic and Thracian populations, creating a unique fusion of cultures. <br>
